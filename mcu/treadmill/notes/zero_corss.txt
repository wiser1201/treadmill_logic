Initialization:
1. sine wave goes to high;
2. MCU captures high input and latches the time;
3. Wait until capture 0 level;
4. Record both captured values;
5. Repeat a certain amount of time;
6. Check if frequency between samples were approximately the same;
7. Calculate the latency between rising/falling edges.
It should be about 10%, which is a lot. So I need to be precise and
fire pulses to open SCRs taking into account this latency.

Normal op:
1. Sine wave goes to high;
2. MCU captures high input, timer starts with predefined period,
one pulse mode;
3. When the timer overflows, MCU gives a sort pulse, duration ~10 us;
4. It's enough to open a SCR. Wait/check RPM, correct period of the
waiting timer.
5. Repeat.
